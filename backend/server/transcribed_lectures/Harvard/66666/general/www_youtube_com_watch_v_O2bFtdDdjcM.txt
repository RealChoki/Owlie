If you want to pronounce it with an American pronunciation, you should use a hard R sound.
And do not use the G in the sound like a G. In fact, we pronounce it more like a J.
So when you put it together, it sounds like Niger.
But if you're from the UK, you would pronounce it with an open R sound.
It would sound like Niger.
But if you're from the local language, which is heavily influenced by the French,
you would pronounce it as Niger.

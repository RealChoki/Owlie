Bonjour!
We are looking at how to pronounce the name of this African country.
Is it Niger or Niger?
This has been a long time asked question.
Well, unlike the neighboring Nigeria that was governed by the English, this country
was a French colony until 1960 and its official language is French, not English.
So the short answer is that even though you would say Nigeria and that would be perfectly
correct, here you would have to adopt the French-sounding pronunciation of Niger.
In French this would be said Niger, Niger, and it's be fine in English or American to
say Niger, Niger, but certainly not Niger, rather Niger.
Give this video a quick thumb up if you found it useful and here are more videos on how to
pronounce country names from all around the world.

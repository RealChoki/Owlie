Hallo

00:01.000 --> 00:06.000
Today I am going to show you how to pronounce German car names

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
I have heard a lot of people pronounce the car names incorrectly

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
And it makes me very angry

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
So for this I am going to teach you how to pronounce the car names correctly now

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
But first I must eat a Lebkuchen

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
So the first wrong car name so many people say

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Audi

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
When it's actually pronounced Audi

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Say it with me

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Audi

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Very easy

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Next

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
BMW

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
In German you say BMW

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
It stands for Bayerische Motorwerke

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Yeah?

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
It is not a funny term

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
It's not to make go and fun laugh

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Okay?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
In English this means

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Bayerische Motorwerks

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Very accurate name

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
More Lebkuchen

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
It's delicious I am enjoying it

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Next

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Mercedes Benz

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Ah this makes me sick

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I am going to have to open a beer

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
The name is pronounced Mercedes Benz

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Now we get to one that really makes me very angry

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I hear the name Porsche a lot

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
I will say this only once

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
In Germany we say Porsche

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Good

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
I don't get this wrong again

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
Here is a toast to Porsche

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
Fun fact this is not beer this is pipiwasser

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Because it is Swiss

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Now we have one for all the preteen 16 year old girls

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You say Opel

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
We say Opel

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Like jeder Popel fÃ¤hrt einen Opel

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
This means every bugger drives an Opel

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I am going to get to the last one

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
You say VW

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
In Germany we say VW

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Get it right

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
This stands for Volkswagen

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
And it means the car of the people

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Hello

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Here is a bonus clip for you

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
I have seen lots of people have difficulty saying this name

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
We got the Koenigsegg

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Swedish Koenigseggs

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Koenigseggs

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
It is pronounced Koenigsegg

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
You are welcome

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Good night

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Good night

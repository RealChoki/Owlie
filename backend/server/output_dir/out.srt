00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hallo

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Today I am going to show you how to pronounce German car names

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I have heard a lot of people pronounce the car names incorrectly

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And it makes me very angry

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So for this I am going to teach you how to pronounce the car names correctly now

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But first I must eat a Lebkuchen

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So the first wrong car name so many people say

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Audi

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
When it's actually pronounced Audi

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Say it with me

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Audi

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Very easy

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Next

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
BMW

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In German you say BMW

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It stands for Bayerische Motorwerke

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah?

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It is not a funny term

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's not to make go and fun laugh

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay?

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In English this means

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Bayerische Motorwerks

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Very accurate name

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
More Lebkuchen

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's delicious I am enjoying it

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Next

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Mercedes Benz

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Ah this makes me sick

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I am going to have to open a beer

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The name is pronounced Mercedes Benz

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Now we get to one that really makes me very angry

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I hear the name Porsche a lot

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I will say this only once

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In Germany we say Porsche

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Good

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't get this wrong again

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Here is a toast to Porsche

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Fun fact this is not beer this is pipiwasser

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Because it is Swiss

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now we have one for all the preteen 16 year old girls

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You say Opel

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We say Opel

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Like jeder Popel fÃ¤hrt einen Opel

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This means every bugger drives an Opel

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I am going to get to the last one

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You say VW

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In Germany we say VW

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Get it right

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This stands for Volkswagen

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And it means the car of the people

51
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hello

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Here is a bonus clip for you

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I have seen lots of people have difficulty saying this name

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We got the Koenigsegg

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Swedish Koenigseggs

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
